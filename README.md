# Sprint 2 - 90803
### Machine Learning Foundations with Python
#### Spring 2024

For this Lab, you will need to do the following:

1. Git clone your repo to your local machine (look back at Lab 1 if you have any doubts), using the SSH connection.
2. Open the `Sprint2_S24_TeamName` jupyter notebook and work through it.
3. It is advisable to work on different branches and, in the end, merge your branches to `main`.
4. Periodically go back to the terminal to commit your changes to your Jupyter Notebook. Do not wait until the end; make sure to commit for at least every question in the notebook. Remember that doing a commit involves:
	-  Making changes to your jupyter notebook
	-  Adding changes to your staging area (`git add`)
	-  Committing, with a descriptive message of the task you are committing (`git commit -m "descriptive message"`).
	-  Add a gitignore `git add .gitignore` - for the files you want the commit to ignore. For example, in MacOS you might want to ignore `.DS_Store`. Add this to your gitignore `echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore`. Other files that you might want to include here are `ipynb_checkpoints/*`.
	-  Here are some links if you want to read more on [ipynb checkpoints](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46421663/what-are-jupyter-notebook-checkpoint-files-for) or how to [gitignore](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35916658/how-to-git-ignore-ipython-notebook-checkpoints-anywhere-in-repository) them.
5. When you are ready to push back to your GitHub remote repo, make sure to:
	- Have any branches merged into `main`
	- `git push origin main`
	- Have your passphrase at hand
	- After the first push, remember to always `git pull` before working on your local repo (to make sure you're up to date) and then `git push` when you are ready to push changes back to your remote repo.



## Notes on this Sprint - To Modify
- Please follow the instructions provided in the videos (CANVAS)
- Once you are done, please answer the questions below. Make sure you have discussed and come to a consensus when addressing the following questions.

> Modify here: 

**1. List the names of all your teammates:**


**2. Agree as a team, what branching strategy do you plan to use in your final projects? Justify your choices**


**3.Communication: Outline how the team will communicate â€” including frequency and methods (e.g., email, WhatsApp, team meetings).  What is the maximum expected response time?**



**4. Decision-Making: How will decisions be made in this team? How will you stay on track? Do you plan on having meetings or any strategies for working through your final project**



**5. As with any team project there is always the possibility of conflict arising, if it does in the future, how will you resolve differences? List at least two strategies**




**6.Commitments: How will you handle different levels of participation and commitment? What process will you follow if someone does not live up to his/her/their responsibilities? (3-5 sentences)**



**7.Diversity: How will you accommodate different learning and working styles? Talk about your own styles and schedules for working and come to an agreement (3-6 sentences)**
